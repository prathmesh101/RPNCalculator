# RPN Calculator

Developed By: Prathmesh Pardhiye

About: This application, is similar to the stock Android Calculator app (without the light-green “advanced” keypad). Unlike the Android calculator, which uses infix notation, this app will use postfix notation, also called Reverse Polish Notation.
While infix notation must respect order of operations and thus requires parentheses and one of several fairly complicated parsing algorithms, postfix notation can be evaluated using a stack and a very simple left-to-right algorithm. This algorithm was put to good use in Hewlett-Packard’s line of scientific calculators.

Environment: This project is built using Android Studio. The UI was developed using XML and Layout style design. Backend coding was done using Java. This application uses SQLite for storing data in the database. Apk version is available. To open apk file navigate: StudentRecruit\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
